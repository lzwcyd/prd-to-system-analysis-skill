## Per-turn Footer

**What I Need From You:** ...
```

## Phase Confirmation Block (CONTEXT_SCAN / SPEC / SPLIT / IMPACT_SCAN / PLAN / REVIEW)

```markdown
-------------------
📌 Current Stage: [CONTEXT_SCAN | SPEC | SPLIT | IMPACT_SCAN | PLAN | REVIEW]

Please confirm whether the following is correct:
1. ...
2. ...

Reply with:
- "Confirm" / "OK" / "Continue" -> move to next phase
- Or provide revisions -> update this phase and reconfirm

Note: if you only send a short confirmation word, it is treated as phase approval.
-------------------
```

## Final Gate Before DOC

```markdown
-------------------
📌 About to enter DOC (generate final system analysis from template)

Confirmed phases: CONTEXT_SCAN / SPEC / SPLIT / IMPACT_SCAN / PLAN
Template to use: {template_path}
Planned outputs: {single_or_multi_docs}

Please confirm whether to generate final documents now:
- Reply "Confirm generation" / "Start drafting" -> enter DOC
- Reply with revisions -> go back to the relevant phase
-------------------
```

## Resume Prompt Block

```markdown
I found existing analysis history in `{artifact_root}`:
- Current state: {current_state}
- Last updated: {last_updated}

Please choose:
1. Resume history (resume)
2. Start over (restart)
```

## Phase-jump Entry Validation Block

```markdown
You asked to start from `{start_phase}`.

Entry validation result:
- Missing upstream artifacts: {missing_artifacts}
- Can continue directly: {can_continue}

Choose next step:
1. Provide missing artifacts and continue
2. Fall back to `{fallback_phase}`
3. Continue with your summary as temporary baseline
```

## Manual Edit Detected Block

```markdown
I detected manual edits in `{artifact_path}` since last sync.

Choose how to proceed:
1. adopt: continue with your edited version
2. merge: merge it with the current draft
3. regenerate: regenerate this phase from latest inputs

Note: if you reply only "OK/Confirm/Continue" without a strategy, default to adopt.
```

## Requirement Correction Rollback Block

```markdown
Detected requirement correction signal: {rollback_trigger}
Recommended rollback phase: {rollback_to_phase}
Impacted artifacts: {stale_artifacts}

Please choose:
1. Roll back and regenerate (recommended)
2. Continue with partial edits only (risk must be acknowledged)
```
